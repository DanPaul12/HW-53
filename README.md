Hey, I apologize for the low quality of work here. Many of the tasks in this assignment were not demonstrated
in the lesson, and while I would normally be happy to search around and experiment to learn how to do them. However, I aalready find vanilla css
easy to use and efficient, and have used it to good effect in other projects. I am in a bit of a time crunch as far as finishing this course
within the given timeframe and I believe my time would be beter spent working on my final project. If you want to give pointers on how to do the
tasks that were not completed, I would be happy to resubmit at a later date. Thank you for understanding.
